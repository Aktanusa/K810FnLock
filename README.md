# K810FnLock

K810FnLock lets you set the Fn Lock on the Logitech K810 Keyboard.  Even though this function is available on Logitech SetPoint software, a lot of people have trouble getting SetPoint working correctly, so this is an alternative.

## Usage

You can use the provided BAT files or manually enter the mode you want via command line:

```powershell
Usage: K810FnLock <-on|-off>
```

I used the research done by **[Mario Scholz](http://www.trial-n-error.de/posts/2012/12/31/logitech-k810-keyboard-configurator)** and used a lot of code from **[Julian Eberius](https://github.com/JulianEberius)**'s repository, **[k811fn](https://github.com/JulianEberius/k811fn)**, which uses the **[HIDAPI](https://github.com/signal11/hidapi)** library.
